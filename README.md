# smart_network

Two fundamental eras of network computing: simple networks for the transfer of information and now smart networks for the trnasfer of value and intelligence
Blockchain and deep learning are built directly into smart networks so that they may automatically confirm authenticity and transfer value(blockchain) and predictively identify individual items and pattens(deep learning)

## Deep Learning Applications for Blockchain

Tensorflow for Fee Estimation

Predictive pattern recongnition for security(Fraud, Privacy, Money-launderung)

Deep Learning techniques to optimize financial graphs 

Formulate debt-credit-pay,emt problems as sigmoidal optimizations to solve with machine learning

## Blockchaiin Applications for Deep Learning

Secure automation, registry, logging, tracking+ remuneration functionality for deep learning system as they go online

BasS for network operations(LSTM is like a payment channel)

Blockchain P2P nodes provide deep learning network services: security(facial recognition), identification, authoization
